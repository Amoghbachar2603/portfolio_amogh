              I'm someone who really enjoys working with a team and believes that clear communication makes everything smoother. During my projects and internship, I've learned how important it is to listen, share ideas openly, and support each other to get things done efficiently. I naturally take initiative when neededâ€”whether that's planning tasks, helping the team stay on track, or stepping up to lead. At the same time, I'm always open to learning from others and adapting to new situations. I try to keep the environment positive, give and take feedback well, and make sure everyone feels comfortable and involved.
